			<p>The veloheld combines minimalist design with superb quality. Devoid of excessive graphics and gear shift components, the veloheld product range delights us with its beauty and simplicity. The black and white (yin and yang?) bicycles feature a short wheelbase, a single gear and a narrow handlebar... All you need to explore the city streets.</p><p>For those who want to create their bike themselves, the veloheld frames come in three sizes and two colours and are the perfect starting point.</p>
